sketch_smartconfig_save_credentials
 
  This file saves WLAN Login Data over smartconfig after first connection in the non volatile Memory of the ESP32.
  BME280 Sensor provides Data via Server / URL.
  (Note: serial monitor printouts about settings only right at the initial connection, but still works)
